; Parameters describing what to do, when to stop and what to save
integrator  = steep         ; Algorithm (steep = steepest descent minimization)
emtol       = 200.0        ; Stop minimization when the maximum force < 1000.0 kJ/mol/nm
emstep      = 0.01          ; Minimization step size
nsteps      = 100000       ; Maximum number of minimization steps to perform

; Parameters describing how to find the neighbors of each atom and how to calculate the interactions
nstlist         = 20      ; Frequency to update the neighbor list and long range forces
cutoff-scheme   = Verlet    ; Buffered neighbor searching
ns_type         = grid      ; Method to determine neighbor list (simple, grid)

coulombtype     = PME       ; Treatment of long range electrostatic interactions
pme_order               = 4         ; Adjust based on accuracy needs (typically 4-6)
fourierspacing          = 0.20     ; Initial grid spacing (adjust for performance)
rcoulomb        = 1.4       ; Short-range electrostatic cut-off
rvdw            = 1.4      ; Short-range Van der Waals cut-off
